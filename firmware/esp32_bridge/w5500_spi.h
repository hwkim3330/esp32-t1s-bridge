// Our own SPI layer under the IDF W5500 driver, for one reason: reads that cross the end of the
// chip's receive buffer.
//
// The evidence, collected rather than reasoned about. Every read the driver has ever failed on --
// twelve out of twelve across two runs -- began in the last kilobyte and a half of the 16 kB
// socket buffer and ran past its end. In-buffer offsets 15014 to 16270, lengths 1434 and 1514.
// Reads starting anywhere else have never failed once, at any rate, with any sensor. That is not
// an overflow, which was the assumption behind six failed fixes; it is a position.
//
// And the driver's own code says why nobody caught it. This is the whole of its buffer read:
//
//     static esp_err_t w5500_read_buffer(emac_w5500_t *emac, void *buffer, uint32_t len,
//                                        uint16_t offset) {
//         return w5500_read(emac, W5500_MEM_SOCK_RX(0, offset), buffer, len);
//     }
//
// One transaction, whatever the length, wherever it starts. The W5500 wraps its socket buffer
// internally so a read past the end is legal on the wire -- but the transaction that carries it
// is not the same shape as one that stays inside, and this bench says that difference is fatal.
// It goes unnoticed on ordinary traffic because a 1500 byte frame has to land within 1500 bytes
// of a 16 kB boundary, which is a tenth of the time, and most Ethernet is not a sensor sending
// 960 back-to-back full frames a second.
//
// So the read is split here instead, at the boundary, into two transactions that each stay inside
// the buffer. Everything else the driver does is left alone: this is a hook it already provides
// (eth_spi_custom_driver_config_t), not a fork of it.
