// Bring up the W5500 without Arduino's ETH class, for one reason: the poll period.
//
// This board's W5500 has no interrupt line -- probing every pin while the sensor streamed found
// nothing outside the SPI, flash and PSRAM buses, so INT is unwired here exactly as RST is. With
// no interrupt the driver polls, and Arduino hardcodes that poll at ten milliseconds
// (libraries/Ethernet/src/ETH.cpp: `if (_pin_irq < 0) mac_config.poll_period_ms = 10;`). There is
// no ioctl to change it afterwards; the value is baked in when the MAC is created.
//
// Ten milliseconds is not a detail here. It means packets are handed over in batches: at 320 a
// second the board saw groups of three or four, 171 us apart -- the cost of pulling one frame
// over SPI -- separated by ten millisecond holes, exactly 100 holes a second. Every arrival time
// this rig recorded was the poll that collected the packet, not the moment it landed. That is
// the whole of the "11 ms gap once a second" this project spent an afternoon chasing through its
// own code, the sensor and the switch, none of which had anything to do with it.
//
// So the MAC is created here with the period we want. Everything above it is untouched: this
// attaches to esp_netif the same way ETH.begin does, so lwIP, NetworkUDP, WebServer and the WiFi
// soft AP all carry on unaware.
